a pillar of wisdom and a comfort to wise men,  
a blessing and a joy to every knight."  
-The Anglo-Saxon Rune Poem

## Introduction

Ōs provides you with an easy way to transliterate the alphabet of modern English (latin) to the runic "alphabet" used for English from around the 4th to the 11th century.

As modern numbers (arabic numerals) hadn't made their way to the British Isles at that time, Roman numerals were typically used. Therefore, this program converts modern numbers to Roman numerals.

Ōs provides you the ability to convert as you type, but it also allows you to import from a text file. Finally, you can choose to either copy the output for whatever purpose, or you may save the output to a text file or LibreOffice document.

## Example input and output

### Latin Input

A Shropshire Lad 2: Loveliest of trees, the cherry now

BY A. E. HOUSMAN

Loveliest of trees, the cherry now  
Is hung with bloom along the bough,  
And stands about the woodland ride  
Wearing white for Eastertide.  

Now, of my threescore years and ten,  
Twenty will not come again,  
And take from seventy springs a score,  
It only leaves me fifty more.  

And since to look at things in bloom  
Fifty springs are little room,  
About the woodlands I will go  
To see the cherry hung with snow.

## Disclaimers

I'm aware that a number of groups (both political, and religious) have tried to appropriate runes for their own ends. I'd like to make it very clear that while I am a supporter of free speech (and that extends to the Futhorc), I do not follow what one author describes as the "cult of unreason" that these folks have decided to associate themselves with.

* This is not a serious academic resource; I'm sure many academics will not be very impressed with what I'm up to here. (Given the choice, _some_ of them seem content to gatekeep this facinating part of our language's history...)
* These are not "Viking runes", although they are a cousin of the Younger Futhark rune sets that were used by the Norse. They had fewer runes, though. I might add support for other Germanic runesets such as this in future.
* I'm aware that several of the runes included are not considered "well attested", due to the lack of historical manuscripts and carvings featuring them. They may have been later inventions post-1066.
  * I'm including them anyway, because it is fun.
  * My intention is to add several different "modes" in the future for various purposes - including a mode suitable for academic purposes. I'd be happy to receive advice and guidance under good faith on this.
