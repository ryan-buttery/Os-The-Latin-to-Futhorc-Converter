## Disclaimer
* This is not a serious academic resource; I'm sure many academics will not be very impressed with what I'm up to here. (Given the choice, many seem content to gatekeep this facinating part of our language's history to themselves...)
* These are not "Viking runes", although they are a cousin of the Younger Futhark rune sets that were used by the Norse. They had fewer runes, though.
* I do not approve of mysticism and other crap (including political...) that people try to use runes for, but freedom of speech and expression applies to futhorc too. I want to claim them back from snakeoil sales(wo)men and extremists.
* This is a fun app that allows you to convert from latin letters to futhorc in real time, or by importing a text file.
* Yes, I know that several of the runes are not considered "well attested", due to the lack of historical manuscripts and carvings featuring them.
* Yes, some of these may have been later inventions post-1066
* I'm including them anyway, because it is fun. Maybe I will add a "super dooper(tm) authentic mode" in the future. 

It has the option of allowing you to save the output as a txt or open office document.

### Latin Input
A Shropshire Lad 2: Loveliest of trees, the cherry now

BY A. E. HOUSMAN

Loveliest of trees, the cherry now
Is hung with bloom along the bough,
And stands about the woodland ride
Wearing white for Eastertide.

Now, of my threescore years and ten,
Twenty will not come again,
And take from seventy springs a score,
It only leaves me fifty more.

And since to look at things in bloom
Fifty springs are little room,
About the woodlands I will go
To see the cherry hung with snow.
