# About this script

I have a slightly strange facination with the rune systems of Germanic languages, with a focus on English runes (the futhorc).

Writing in these is fairly easy, but I'd like a way to generate a bunch of text to practice my reading. 

The mappings in this repo are incomplete and would probably cause academics in this subjects to riot. Chill. It's just for testing right now... 

I have my copy of the "little red rune book", and I will be using the recommendations from this to make the transliteration as accurate as possible.

Squeezing the many sounds of modern English into the futhorc is a challenge and will no doubt spark further riots... but we manage it with the latin alphabet without any special characters. 

I'm sure we will manage here...

## Ultimate Aim

Currently it just takes in a string and spits it back out into the terminal. That sucks.

My intention is to pass it text files (or maybe even docx or ods files), and have it spit a file back out ready to go.

Maybe it will read PDFs one day... Maybe I'll get bored, or busy with life.
